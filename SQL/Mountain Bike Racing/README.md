# Mountain Bike Racing

In these three lab files, created as homework assignments, I have developed a comprehensive, normalized database system for storing and managing details in the mountain bike racing field.

The project encompasses a range of database operations, from basic data manipulation to advanced procedures and functions. Each query is designed with practical usage in mind, incorporating relationships between tables to ensure data integrity and efficiency.

Throughout this project, I demonstrate my database knowledge, including:
* Database normalization principles
* Table relationship management
* Basic to advanced SQL query writing
* Creation and implementation of stored procedures and functions

Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my knowledge in database management and SQL, showcasing skills that can be readily adapted and enhanced for more complex, large-scale projects as needed.
