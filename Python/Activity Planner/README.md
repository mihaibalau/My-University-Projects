## Problem Statements

### 5. Activity Planner
The following information is stored in a personal activity planner:
- **Person**: `person_id`, `name`, `phone_number`
- **Activity**: `activity_id`, `person_id` - list, `date`, `time`, `description`

Create an application to:
1. Manage persons and activities. The user can add, remove, update, and list both persons and activities.
2. Add/remove activities. Each activity can be performed together with one or several other persons, who are already in the userâ€™s planner. Activities must not overlap (user cannot have more than one activity at a given time).
3. Search for persons or activities. Persons can be searched for using name or phone number. Activities can be searched for using date/time or description. The search must work using case-insensitive, partial string matching, and must return all matching items.
4. Create statistics:
    - Activities for a given date. List the activities for a given date, in the order of their start time.
    - Busiest days. This will provide the list of upcoming dates with activities, sorted in ascending order of the free time in that day (all intervals with no activities).
    - Activities with a given person. List all upcoming activities to which a given person will participate.
